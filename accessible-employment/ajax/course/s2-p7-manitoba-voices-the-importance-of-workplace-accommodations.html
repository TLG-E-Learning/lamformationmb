            <p>Narrator: Accessiblity in the Workplace: Good for Everyone, Law in Manitoba</p>


            <p>Cory Beal: We are always looking for ways to make things safer, simpler, and faster. </p>
            And when something makes things safer, simpler, and faster for everybody, that’s not really an accommodation for one person, that’s an improvement for the whole company.</p>


            <p>Melissa Yankoski: It’s important to have a diverse workforce so that we are representative of our community and that we’re ensuring that everyone feels welcomed and included.</p>


            <p>Dianna Rasing: I don’t see it as a disability or ability. Everyone comes with different skills at the table. </p>


            <p>Minh Huynh: The accommodation can also almost be a very small factor when it actually comes to actually needing it. </p>
            <p>Because support comes with trust, trust comes with support. </p>


            <p>Colin Mathieson: For an employer, I think it’s a great opportunity to sort of sharpen the pencils and look through a different lens that they might not have had to look through before.</p>
