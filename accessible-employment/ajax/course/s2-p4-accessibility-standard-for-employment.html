    <h1>The Accessibility Standard for Employment</h1>
    <p>Enacted on May 1, 2019, the <a link="rel" href="http://accessibilitymb.ca/employment-standards.html" target="_blank">Accessibility Standard for Employment (opens in new tab)</a> is the second standard to come into force under The Accessibility for
        Manitobans Act. The first is the <a link="rel" href="http://accessibilitymb.ca/css-business-and-non-profit.html" target="_blank">Accessibility Standard for
            Customer
            Service (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that all employers remove and prevent <a link="rel" href="#" class="terms" data-terms="barriers">barriers</a> at various stages of employment. </p>
    <p>When it comes to the workplace, it is often the little things that can create barriers for employees and colleagues with disabilities. For instance, barriers can be in a process, such as signing in for work, or be a physical barrier, like boxes crowding
        a corridor. Discriminatory or negative attitudes are often the greatest barrier of all.</p>

    <h2>How is this Standard Different than Manitoba’s Existing Employment Standards?</h2>
    <p>Most employers are already familiar with Manitoba’s Employment Standards, which set out the minimum fairness standards for the workplace. The Accessibility Standard for Employment is different in that it focuses specifically on accessibility in the
        employment cycle. </p>

        <li class="dfn-barriers"> Barriers are obstacles that limit access and prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in everyday life. Most barriers are not intentional. Barriers usually arise because spaces, goods or services do not take into account users’
            diversity of abilities. For instance, this might be related to height, strength, memory or understanding.
