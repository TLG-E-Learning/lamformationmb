                <p>Manitoba’s efforts will focus on collaboration, education and the training of organizations to fulfill the requirements set out in the law. Like other laws, the AMA also sets out enforcement measures, including orders to comply and monetary
                    penalties for non-compliant organizations.</p>

                <p> Accessibility Standards, or regulations, are the building blocks of the The Accessibility for Manitobans Act. Standards outline who has to do what and by when, to enhance accessibility.
                    <p>The Manitoba Government appointed an Accessibility Advisory Council to assist in developing five standards under the AMA, affecting accessibility in customer service, employment, information and communications, the design of public
                        spaces and transportation.</p><br>
