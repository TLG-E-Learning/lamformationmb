    <h1>Accessible Selection</h1>
    <h2>What can you do to meet the accessible selection requirement?
    </h2>
    <p>When inviting applicants to participate in the selection process, tell candidates that reasonable accommodations for the assessment process are available upon request, whether for an interview, written test, or on-the-job skills demonstration.</p>

    <p>When applicants make a request, consult with them about what types of accommodations would work best.</p>


    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul class="list-check">
        <li>Use standardized interview scripts, questions and scoring to avoid bias among candidates in the interview process. </li>
        <li>Never assume what a candidate can or cannot do. For example, if a position requires a valid driver’s license, do not assume that a candidate who uses a wheelchair is unable to drive. </li>
    </ul>
