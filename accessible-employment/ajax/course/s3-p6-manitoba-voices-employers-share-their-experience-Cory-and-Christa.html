            <p>Cory Beal: Having a hard-of-hearing employee really made me think about the accommodations for him right, and instantly we saw the benefits for other people.</p>
            <p>And the example I love to use is, you can't get someone’s attention, when they're hard of hearing, from behind. You have to be in their line of sight.</p>
            <p>When we moved into our huge new space, when we were orienting the work-stations, we oriented most of them, as many as we could, oriented them out, or added like mirrors or at least something to be able to see behind you.</p>
            <p>And the unexpected benefit to that is for everybody.</p>
            <p>Like, I don't like being hollered at from behind when I'm like concentrating on something, I don't like being snuck up on.</p>
            <p>That was a big eye-opener, that even these small accommodations like turning work stations around, were hugely beneficial to everyone.</p>
            <p>It makes me want to hire more unique perspectives because we're not going to grow, and we're not going to change, and we're not going to get these new ideas if we all have the same perspectives.</p>

            <p>Business is all about, you want to be successful, you want it to financially succeed; business is risky.</p>
            <p>These employees can do just as good as every other employee, sometimes even better.</p>
            <p>I just have nothing negative to say about hiring somebody with a disability.</p>
