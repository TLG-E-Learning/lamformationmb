    <h1>The Need for Legislation</span>
    </h1>
    <p>Nearly one in four Manitobans face barriers to <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="accessibility">accessibility</a> in daily living.</p>
    <p>All Manitobans, regardless of their abilities, have the right to participate fully in society, and to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
    <p>By introducing a law, government organizations (like schools and universities), businesses, and non-profit organizations must all collaborate to make Manitoba accessible.</p>
