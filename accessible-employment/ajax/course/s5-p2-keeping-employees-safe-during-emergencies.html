    <p>To ensure the safety of employees with disabilities, as of <strong>May 1, 2020</strong>, all Manitoba employers have been required to comply with the following two requirements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Workplace Emergency Response Information</strong>
            <ul class="list-empty-bullet">
                <li>Create emergency response information to help employees with disabilities stay safe during emergencies.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Workplace Emergency Assistance</strong>
            <ul class="list-empty-bullet">
                <li> Ask employees who require assistance during an emergency for permission to share information with individuals who agree to help.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


    </ol>
    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>

    <p>Plan ahead. Do not wait for an emergency evacuation to learn who has difficulty descending stairs, which employee has severe asthma, or who is immobilized by panic attacks.</p>
    <p>Ensure you will meet the needs of your employees during a variety of emergencies, including for example, an evacuation, a lock down, or a pandemic.</p>
    <p>The following steps are designed to meet the requirements of the standard, but may be modified to meet your organization’s needs.</p>
    <p>Each step is supported by documentation found in the <a target="_blank" href="http://accessibilitymb.ca/pdf/workplace_emergency_toolkit.pdf">Workplace Emergency Response
            Information Toolkit (PDF)</a>. This toolkit is also found at <a link="rel" target="_blank" href="https://accessibilitymb.ca/">AccessibilityMB.ca (opens in new tab) </a> and includes a sample of each of the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Employee memo to all employees asking if they require assistance in an emergency</li>
        <li>Employee Emergency Information Worksheet</li>
        <li>Employee Emergency Response Information Template, and</li>
        <li>Consent form to share emergency response information with colleagues who agree to help</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Five Steps for Meeting this Requirement</h3>
    <p>Select the headings to learn about each of the five steps. </p>

            <p>
                Learn more about emergency procedures that affect your workplace. For example, if you have not done so already, review your building’s evacuation plan. Share information about emergency procedures with your employees.

            <br>
            <p>Talk to your employees about your organization’s efforts to create accessibility and to keep all employees safe during an emergency in the workplace.</p>
            <p> Invite employees to notify you confidentially about their accessibility needs during an emergency. The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that the information employees share with you, as an employer, remains confidential and shared
                only:
                <ul class="list-no-bullet">
                    <li>a) with their permission, and </li>
                    <li>b) with someone who is designated to help them in an emergency.</li>
