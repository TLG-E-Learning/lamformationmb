    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that employers follow a return to work process for employees who have been off work due to a disability or health conditions, and that employers provide reasonable workplace accommodations upon their
        return.
    </p>
    <p>A <strong>return to work policy</strong> is a proactive way to help employees with disabilities and health conditions to stay at work, or return to work as soon as it is safe to do so. This typically involves modifying and graduating employee duties
        and hours at work, according to their functional abilities.</p>

    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce a return to work policy that ensures reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities and health conditions, by modifying duties and work schedules based on their abilities.</li>
        <li>In your policy, include a description of the process that your organization follows to determine the accommodations necessary for a safe and healthy return to work. For example, who will communicate with the employee, and when will the communication
            occur?
        </li>
