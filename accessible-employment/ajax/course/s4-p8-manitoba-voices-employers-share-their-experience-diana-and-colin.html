            <p> <strong>Dianna Rasing, Administrative Assistant</strong></p>
            <p>I used to be a sign language interpreter at Red River College, and then I got sick, I had a stroke.</p>
            <p>And so over the course of my rehabilitation, they found a new position for me, and within that finding of a new position, I had to have the conversation of what I can and cannot do.</p>
            <p>They asked me how they can accommodate me and my needs.</p>
            <p>They were very supportive in finding me a totally different position that I could do.</p>
            <p>Once they found that position, the supervisor was accommodating to certain things that we could tweak.</p>
            <p>Like so for instance, the past admin assistant would take notes verbatim, and I said, “Well I won't be able to do that.”</p>
            <p>And so we had that conversation and that’s been working out fine.</p>

            <p> <strong>Colin Mathieson, Employment Counsellor</strong></p>
            <p>I'm very fortunate that being in a wheelchair I roll into a room and it's pretty obvious that I am in a wheelchair, so I have that as a benefit.</p>
            <p>My message to an employer would be that you know, individuals typically have a really good sense of what they need, and if you're receptive you'll be able to have those conversations with them and everybody's going to benefit.</p>
