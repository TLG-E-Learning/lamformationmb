    <h1>Workplace Accommodations – A Shared Responsibility</h1>
    <p><strong>Workplace accommodations are a shared responsibility.</strong></p>

    <p> When employers and employees collaborate to overcome barriers, they are most likely to find the right workplace accommodations. </p>

    <p> Employees should notify their employer if they need a workplace accommodation. They should also be prepared to discuss options for accommodations. </p>

    <p> Treating employees with dignity and respect means maintaining privacy about personal employee information and the reasons for accessibility accommodations.
