    <h1>Key Features</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Accessible Employment learning module. Before you continue, please review the following information about the key module features.</p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>This module is organized into six sections and includes a glossary of terms. You can navigate through this module by using the Previous and Next links at the bottom of each page, or the main menu on the left side of the page.</p>
    <p>The main menu is organized into module sections. When you select a section title, the menu will expand to show all content in that section. Selecting a different title will open new content. You can use the main menu to move freely between module
        sections.

    <h2>Knowledge Checks </h2>
    <p>Sections two, four and six of this module end with a Knowledge Check to help you check your understanding of the material.</p>

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>Each page offers you the option to listen to the contents of the page. To play the audio, navigate to the upper right corner of the page and click the Listen button. You can use the forward and backward buttons to control the audio for the page. Remember
        to turn your speakers on first.</p>
