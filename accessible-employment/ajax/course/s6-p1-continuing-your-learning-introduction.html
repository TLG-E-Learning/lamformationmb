    <h1>Continuing Your Learning: Introduction</h1>
    <p> This is the final section of the module. This section provides information about how to continue learning about accessibility in your organization. </p>
    <p>There is a final Knowledge Check at the end of this section.</p>
    <p>We hope that you can put into practice what you have learned about Manitoba’s accessibility law by meeting the requirements, and by implementing the tips to remove barriers in the workplace.</p>
    <p>Learning about accessibility is not a one time or static exercise. As you learned in Section 2, the Accessibility Standard for Employment is one of five standards that will be implemented throughout Manitoba’s public and private sectors. </p>
