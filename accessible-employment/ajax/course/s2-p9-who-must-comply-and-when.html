    <h1>Who Must Comply and When?</h1>
    <h2>Who Must Comply with the Accessible Employment Standard?</h2>

    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment targets all Manitoba businesses and organizations with paid employees, including those who are full time, part time, apprentices or seasonal, and participate in human resource management.
    </p>
    <p> It does not apply to volunteers and other non-paid individuals.</p>
    <p> The Accessibility Standard for Employment helps <em>all</em> Manitoba organizations hire, support and keep employees.</p>

    <h2> Compliance Deadlines </h2>
    <p>Under the standard, different types of organizations are given different timelines to meet their legal requirements. The following table summarizes the requirements and timelines. </p> <br>
