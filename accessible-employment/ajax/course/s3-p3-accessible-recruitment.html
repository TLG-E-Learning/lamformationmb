    <h1>Accessible Recruitment</h1>
    <h2>What can you do to meet the accessible recruitment requirement?
    </h2>
    <p>When advertising a job position, be sure to inform applicants that the organization will respond to requests for reasonable accommodation during the assessment and selection process. This will notify your existing employees and the public that the
        organization will support their participation in all aspects of the recruitment process.
    </p>

    <div class="adbox">
        <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Sample Job Ad Wording</h3>
        [Name of Organization] welcomes applications from people with disabilities. Applicants may request reasonable accommodation related to the materials or activities used throughout the selection process.</p>
        <p>Or: Disability accommodations are available upon request.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul class="list-check">
        <li>Do not create requirements that are not necessary to perform the job. For example, do not require applicants to have an active driver’s license, when they could use an alternate form of transportation to carry out their job. Consider what is actually
            needed to do the job.</li>
        <li>Educate and train managers/recruiters on inclusive interviewing processes.</li>
        <li>Share the job advertisement with employment agencies that serve people with disabilities. Agencies can provide guidance and assist you and the new employee during the recruitment process.</li>
    </ul>
