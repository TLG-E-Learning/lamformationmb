    <h1>
        Meet Employees’ Communication Needs
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that employers communicate with employees in a way that meets their communication needs.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What can you do to meet this requirement?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Respond to requests from employees who need information in
        <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="accessible-formats"> accessible formats</a> or who require
        <a href="#" class="terms" data-terms="communication-support">communication supports.</a>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Accessible format</strong> means providing static information in a way that works for a person disabled by a barrier, and includes large print, recorded audio, electronic formats and braille.</p>
    <p><strong>Communication support</strong> means two-way communication that works for a person disabled by a barrier and includes, for example, texting, handwriting and augmentative and alternative communication supports.</p>
    <p>Accessible formats and communication supports can be requested for:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Information required for the employee to perform their job, and</li>
            <li>Infomation generally available to all employees</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Employers should consult with employees to determine their accessibility needs and how best to accommodate them.</p>
