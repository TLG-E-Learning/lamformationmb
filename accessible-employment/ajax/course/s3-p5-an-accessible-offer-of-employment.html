    <h1>An Accessible Offer of Employment </h1>
    <h2>What can you do to meet the offering employment requirement?
    </h2>
    <p>When making an offer of employment to a successful candidate, you must inform the individual about the organization’s policies and practices regarding reasonable workplace accommodations. This could be verbally, by email, or in an offer letter.
    </p>

    <div class="adbox">
        <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Sample Wording</h3>
        <p>[Name of Organization] provides <strong>reasonable</strong> workplace accommodations for employees with disabilities or medical needs. If you require an accommodation because of a disability or a medical need, please contact [Company Representative,
            Title] at [Telephone number] or by e-mail at [Email].</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Tip</h3>
    <ul class="list-check">
        <li>Many employees who could benefit from an accommodation may fear that disclosing a disability will negatively impact their career, so offer reassurance to new employees that you wish to support their success.
        </li>

    </ul>
