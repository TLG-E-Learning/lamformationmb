    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that employers treat information related to an accommodation, including any external evaluations, as confidential. This includes personal health information protected by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/phia/index.html">The Personal Health Information
        Act (Manitoba) (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>

    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Only collect, use or disclose personal health information as required to meet the Accessibility Standard for Employment, unless the employee consents to other use or disclosure.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of other privacy requirements under <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/fippa/">The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (opens in new tab)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/phia/index.html">The Personal Health Information Act (opens in new tab)</a>,
            where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul class="list-check">
        <li>Limit access to employee information to managers or others working in human resources.</li>
        <li>Managers should not discuss information with other employees, unless approved by the employee for organizational purposes. e.g., to prepare for a barrier free emergency evacuation plan.</li>
        <li>Store related forms and information in a secure place.</li>
    </ul>
