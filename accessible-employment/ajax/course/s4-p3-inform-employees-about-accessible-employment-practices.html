        Inform Employees About Accessible Employment Practices
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that employers inform all employees, both new and existing, about their accessible employment policies and practices related to workplace accommodations, as well as any changes or updates to these. </p>
    <p>This will ensure that all employees are aware of how the organization will support them if they have a disability, or may acquire a disability later in their career.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What can you do to meet this requirement?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Document and share your organization’s policies and practices related to workplace accommodation with employees. Let staff know how to access them, and provide updates on any changes.
    </p>
