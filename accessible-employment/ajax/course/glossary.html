                not merely assumptions about how hard it would be to accommodate a person’s special needs. For more information, please visit the Manitoba Human Rights Commission’s guideline on <a link="rel" target="_blank" href="http://www.manitobahumanrights.ca/v1/education-resources/resources/reasonable-accommodation.html">Reasonable Accommodation in the Workplace (opens in new tab)</a>.
