    <h1>Module Overview</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This free learning resource provides Manitoba organizations with an opportunity to meet the minimum training requirements of the Accessibility Standard for Employment. </p>
    <p>An employer must ensure they train staff with the following responsibilities:
        <ul>
            <li>recruiting, selecting, or training employees</li>
            <li>supervising, managing, or coordinating the work of employees</li>
            <li>promoting or redeploying employees</li>
            <li>developing and implementing employment policies and practices</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The module information should be complemented by a review or discussion of your organization’s policies, practices and measures related to accessible employment. </p>
    <p> The module is designed for individual use. However, group discussion is a great way to determine how accessibility laws affect your organization. Please view the <a target="_blank" href="./resources/E_FacilitatorsGuide_EN.pdf">Facilitator’s Guide (PDF)</a>        for assistance. </p>

    <h2> Learning Overview </h2>
    <p>This learning module was designed to meet the training needs of specific employees within an organization who need to receive training on accessible employment, such as managers and Human Resource practitioners. The purpose of the Facilitator’s Guide
        is to help businesses and organizations consider how the new requirements affect their human resource policies and practices through a group discussion. This module has been organized into six sections, including the one you are currently in.
