    <h1>Create Individualized Accommodation Plans</h1>
    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires that employers develop and implement individual accommodation plans for employees that request them. An employer, who recognizes an employee’s accommodation needs, may also propose developing a plan.</p>
    <p> <strong>An individual accommodation plan</strong> is a formal way of recording and reviewing the workplace-related accommodations that will be provided to an employee with a disability.</p>
    <p> The individualized accommodation plan must document actions used to provide the employee with details about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>accessible formats or communication supports</li>
        <li> workplace emergency accommodations</li>
        <li>any other reasonable accommodations to remove workplace barriers</li>
        <li>when workplace accommodations will be provided, reviewed and, if necessary, updated </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?

    </h2>
    <P>Work with an employee with a disability to identify accommodations that best meet individual needs. </p>
    <p>Employers and employees must both participate in the creation and implementation of an individualized accommodation plan. Working together and in good faith, you are likely to come up with a plan that works. </p>

                    <li>Employers must respond to requests from employees with disabilities to create an individualized accommodation plan. Management may also ask employees if they require a workplace accommodation and propose a plan.</li>
                    <li>To help determine the accommodation(s) required, employers may request an evaluation of an employee by an independent regulated health professional, or other worker in the area of workplace accommodations. Employers are required to
                        pay for these evaluations.</li>
                    <li>Employers are not obliged to select the specific accommodation that the employee requests. Accommodations should remove barriers and be reasonable. When in doubt on what constitutes a reasonable accommodation, it is best to consult
                        with an independent professional, per above.</li>
                    <li>If the employer denies an employee’s request for an individual accommodation plan, the employer must provide the employee written reasons for why the request was denied.</li>
                    <li>The employer must set a timeframe for the review of the accommodation plan, and update the plan if requested by the employee, or whenever there is a change related to the job, workspace or other related factors.</li>

                    <li>The employee must comply with the accommodation plan and provide updates about necessary modifications, or when an accommodation is no longer required.</li>
                    <li>The employee may be represented by a bargaining agent or a person who is knowledgeable in the area of workplace accommodations during the development of the individualized accommodation plan.</li>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Many employees find it difficult to ask for an accommodation, and the reason for the accommodation may be sensitive to the employee. Things you can do as a supervisor:
                <ul class="list-dash">
                    <li>Create a safe space to speak and listen to the employee, without judgment. </li>
                    <li>Try to understand what the concern is and how you can help. </li>
                    <li>Stay focused on what someone needs to do their job the best.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Include information about workplace accommodations in orientation materials. </li>
                <li>Print and post in the staff area the one-page information sheet called “Discussing Accessibility in the Workplace”:
                    <ul class="list-empty-bullet">
                        <li>

                    <li>
