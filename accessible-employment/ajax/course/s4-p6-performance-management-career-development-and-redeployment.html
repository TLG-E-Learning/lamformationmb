    <h1>Performance Management, Career Development, and Redeployment</h1>
    <p>The Accessibility Standard for Employment requires employers to consider how barriers may affect the following three areas of human resource management: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Performance management</strong>: Performance management refers to activities related to assessing and improving employee performance, productivity and effectiveness, with the goal of facilitating employee success and planning the way forward.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Career development</strong>: Career development is usually based on merit or seniority, or a combination of both. It can involve increasing the responsibilities within an employee’s current position, or in a position at a higher level
            in an organization. Training is an important part of career development.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Redeployment</strong>: When a particular job or department has been eliminated, an organization may reassign employees to other departments or jobs as an alternative to layoffs.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <p>These requirements only apply if the organization currently has these processes in place. Organizations are not required to establish these processes if they do not already exist.</p>
    <h2>What can you do to meet each of these requirements?</h2>
    <p>Select the headings below to see some examples of how these requirements could be applied in an organization.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accessible formats and meet the communication support needs of the employee in related discussions and documentation.</li>
                    <li>In determining the impact of a temporary or permanent disability on an employee’s performance, consider that there may be more than one workplace barrier which could affect their performance.</li>
                    <li>Review an employee's individualized accommodation plan, to determine if adjustments can be made to the plan to improve job performance. For instance, changes to disability or medical needs can occur at any time, and may require modifications
                        to the plan.</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul class="list-check">
            <li>Consider a formal process for performance management with a pre-scheduled discussion.</li>
            <li>Provide written feedback that documents expectations and guides the next steps.</li>
            <li>Ensure supervisor attitudes reflect the organization’s commitment to disability inclusion, so preconceptions do not affect the evaluation of an employee’s performance.</li>

                <li>When recruiting or selecting employees for training and promotion, consider first how the barrier(s) affecting an employee with a disability can be addressed.</li>
                <li>Adjust accommodation supports, or update an individualized accommodation plan with the employee's participation, to address any barriers that may affect the employee's opportunities, new role or responsibilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Tip</h4>
        <ul class="list-check">
            <li>When developing or contracting out training programs, consider the accommodation needs of your employees in advance. For example, tell trainers whether employees require accommodations for the training. Sending training material in advance
                may help. </li>
