    <p>The standard requires that employers of all large public sector organizations and Manitoba organizations with 50 or more employees document all accessible employment policies and practices, including a policy on individual accommodation plans. These
        organizations must also document in writing the content and timeframe for training relevant employees.</p>
    <p>The documents must be publicly available and in accessible formats, by request.</p>
    <p> While organizations with 49 or fewer employees do not have to document accessible employment policies, it is a best practice to do so, as it promotes a clear and consistent approach for accommodating employees with disabilities.</p>

    <h2>What can you do to meet this requirement?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a written record of accessible employment policies and practices, including a summary of training content, and when training is offered.</li>
        <li>Have a policy on <a link="rel" target="_blank" href="http://accessibilitymb.ca/pdf/IAP_guide_PSO.pdf">Individualized Accommodation Plans (PDF)</a> that meets the requirements of section 13(2) of the <a link="rel" target="_blank" href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/regs/current/_pdf-regs.php?reg=70/2019">Accessible Employment Standard Regulation (PDF)</a>.</li>
        <li>Let the public know that accessible employment policies and practices are available on request, and in accessible formats.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul class="list-check">
        <li>Maintaining a policy to support individualized accommodation plans helps <em>all</em> organizations ensure a clear and consistent approach for accommodating employees with disabilities.</li>
        <li>To create your policy, use the “Guide to Create an Individualized Accommodation Plan Process and Policy for Public Sector Organizations”, including Sample Policy Template and Sample Individual Accommodation Plan Worksheet.

            </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Write your policies in plain language, so that everyone can understand them.</li>
            <li>Add an accessibility page to your website where the public can view accessibility policies and practices.</li>

        <li class="dfn-support-person"> In relation to a person who is disabled by a barrier, a support person is someone who accompanies that person to:
            <ul>
                <li>support the person obtaining, using or benefiting from a good or service provided by an organization</li>
                <li>assist the person in addressing his or her communication, mobility, personal care or medical needs</li>

        <li class="dfn-service-animal">Defined by The Human Rights Code (Manitoba), a service animal is trained to assist a person with a disability. The work or tasks a service animal performs must be directly related to a person’s physical or mental disability. Animals that provide
            comfort and companionship, but are not trained to assist with a person’s disability, are not service animals. For more information on service animals, please visit the<a link="rel" target="_blank" href="http://www.manitobahumanrights.ca/v1/"> Manitoba Human Rights Commission</a>.
